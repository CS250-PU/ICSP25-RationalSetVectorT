/* TODO #1: Ask the user to enter a Rational number then output the Rational
            number. Interaction is to look like:
            Enter a Rational: 1/2
            Rational entered: 1/2

   TODO #2: Ask the user to enter a RationalSet number then output the 
            RationalSet. Interaction is to look like:
            Enter a RationalSet: {1/2 2/3 3/4}
            RationalSet entered: {1/2, 2/3, 3/4}

   TODO #3: Create a vector that can hold a unknown number of RationalSets.
            Read in each RationalSet from the file RationalSets.txt into
            the vector. Then output each RationalSet. Interaction is to look
            like:
            RationalSets:
            {}
            {1/2}
            {1/2, 2/3}
            {2/3, 3/4, 4/5}
